I believe that good application design is a combination of both good technical design and implementation coupled with good visual design and user experience.

With over a decade of experience as a creative full-stack web developer, my main expertise lies in developing innovative concepts and prototyping them into digital experiences. I thrive on transforming ideas into engaging, interactive experiences. I've developed robust design systems that ensure consistency and efficiency throughout the development process. By blending leading web technologies with a deep understanding of user experience, I build seamless and intuitive interfaces which will engage and delight users.

### About This Website

Although I am not a particularly prolific blogger, I do occasionally like to share things that I've learned, even if just for my own benefit. I don't engage with any social networks and I am strong advocate of [Digital Gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) were there is less focus on polished, long form articles, rather seeing personal websites as continually in development. Maintaining a minimal website enables me to focus more on just publishing content and cultivating as I go along. 

It is also important to me to keep my site free from anything people might find intrusive, so there are no trackers or ads to be found here.
