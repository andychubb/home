My career has allowed me to get involved in a wide variety of different projects from brand lead, engaging interactive experiences though to multi-faceted e-commerce applications. As a software engineer I have worked on building back-end services using technologies including Node.js, PHP, Docker and Kubernetes and also spent time crafting interfaces using technologies such as JavaScript and TypeScript and working with frameworks such as React and Vue. I have a strong track record of shipping performant, well built browser-based experiences. 

### Platform Development and Engineering

Most recently on my developer journey I have been working in platform development and engineering, as web applications grow and the web evolves the way these web application are maintained and worked on changes too. Typically it's not possible to shift large, complex applications to new platforms quickly and without impact. 

Working on bigger systems taught me the importance of engineering at scale, I've been working on applications which need to scale and using technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes and AWS. It's also a journey into really improving the developer experience of the teams which I work on, this ranges from writing custom pipelines to ensure the deployment processes run smoothly, sitting on roundtables to determine the optimal way to write and format code to allow for more collaborative working. 

### Design Systems

My work as a front end developer expanded to a point where design systems began to make sense. When building large applications it becomes impractical to manually hand-roll each page and a different approach is needed. Building a design system is equal parts design and coding. Each component needs to be flexible enough to work in many different contexts but also lean enough so that it doesn't impact on the performance of the application. I worked on a number of design systems which formed part of the front end rebuilds of many university websites. These projects established to have a long life span and meet all of the establishments needs going forward, they needed to be adaptable and accessible, as the projects would eventually be handed over to the universities internal team to continue development and maintenance. 

### Front End Development

My initial foray into web development came from the desktop design world. Converting design files build in applications like Photoshop and Illustrator into interactive websites. In the early days I worked with tools like Flash, but as the web evolved I moved into HTML, CSS and JavaScript and all the browser innovations that came along in those years. I was always striving to create unique sites that had strong design elements, but I also learned the importance of performance and accessibility and as I changed my approach as the web and the browsers and hardware we used evolved.

I worked on many different Content Management and E-Commerce systems such as WordPress, Magento and Shopify, integrating brand and design elements to create bespoke experiences on these platforms. I also worked on a number of custom built websites and content management systems built by internal teams.
